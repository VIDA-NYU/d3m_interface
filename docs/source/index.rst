Welcome to D3M Interface's documentation!
=========================================

D3M Interface is a python library which enable data scientics to use D3M AutoML Systems. It contains an implementation to integrate D3M TA2 systems with Jupyter Notebooks using the TA3-TA2 API. It provides a familiar interface, that is similar to other AutoML systems likes H2O and TPOT, to make easier for people to adopt D3M tools.

D3M Interface supports six TA2 systems: NYU, CMU, SRI, TAMU, and UC Berkeley.
