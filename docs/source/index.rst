Welcome to D3M Interface's documentation!
=========================================

`d3m-interface` is a Python library which enable data scientist to use D3M AutoML systems.
It contains an implementation to integrate D3M AutoML systems with Jupyter Notebooks.
It provides a familiar interface, that is similar to other AutoML systems like H2O and TPOT, to make easier for people to adopt D3M tools.
 
`d3m-interface` allows data scientists to explore, understand, and build trust on the derived models. This allows them to make an informed decision regarding which model to choose, as well as to improve and customize the solution. `d3m-interface` supports six D3M AutoML systems: AlphaD3M (NYU), CMU, SRI, TAMU, UC Berkeley and UNCHARTED.
